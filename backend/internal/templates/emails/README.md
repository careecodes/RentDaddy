# Email Templates for Documenso Integration

These template files are maintained for historical reference, but are no longer actively used since Documenso now handles email sending directly.

## Note on Current Email Handling

Documenso now manages all email notifications for document signing workflows:
- Sending signature requests
- Notifying when documents are signed
- Providing download links for completed documents

## Branding Options

For custom branding in emails, Documenso offers configuration options through its Teams feature. See the Documenso documentation for details on customizing email appearance.

## Previous Template Structure (Deprecated)

These files were previously used with the documenso-worker component:
1. `sign_request.html` - Template for signature request emails
2. `signing_complete.html` - Template for signing completion notifications
3. `config.json` - Configuration for template subjects and filenames

If custom email templates are needed in the future, refer to the Documenso API documentation for current integration options.
